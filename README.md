# Computer Vision Project: Adding Holograms information in a Virtual environment

* In this Repository you can find the project of the Computer vision that we have implemented during the Course
    
    You can see the following files:
    - Re-adaptation of potreee according to our needs (in folder Potree)
    - COLMAP Elaboration (in folder Colmap)
    - Python script to Modify the Exif file (in folder Colmap)
    - Python script to compute the scale factor between image with GPS coordinate and without (in folder Colmap)

## To use the potree file following this step:
### 1. Remember to install the packages of node.js inside the POTREE folder
```bash
npm install
```
### 2. update the package
```bash
npm update
```
### 3. Run on your PC using this code
```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Open your browser and go to: localhost:1234/examples

## IMPORTANT
If you want to use the "contatore" model, you need to copy the file "octree.bin" contained in the zip folder ("Octree model" -> "octree.bin") to the folder Potree -> pointclouds -> contatore

## To use the Colmap, before download colmap:
```bash
node https://colmap.github.io/install.html
```
